# Quick COVID-19 Reports

> Quick Note: in its current state, it does not try to answer meaningful questions. The goal is to create a React JS codebase from a COVID-19 Philippines data source. How you want to empower that data is up to those who will improve this project (or if I get the time, I might take a jab at it ðŸ˜‰).

As with the increasing number of cases with COVID-19, this repository was created as an experiment to see if we can extract meaningful trends from the data that we know so far.

To help us out, we're using a dataset collated in in Google Sheet (all credit goes to John Rich Nicdao). The sheet is also updated through the `Data Science Philippines Discussion Group`.

## Dataset

- [COVID-19 Philippines: Cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/16g_PUxKYMC0XjeEKF6FPUBq2-pFgmTkHoj5lbVrGLhE/htmlview)

## Stack and frameworks / tools used

- React JS
- Materialize CSS
- Chartist JS

## Contributing

This repo is open for pull requests and forks. I'll try to implement a CI / CD pipeline that targets the `master` branch.

Just execute the commands below in `Bash` to build and run the app.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
